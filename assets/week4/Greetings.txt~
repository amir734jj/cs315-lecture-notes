Issues with Program 1 (there is still time to fix it):
    1. forgetting to initialize sum and count registers to zero (-5 points)
    
    2. forgetting to write comments or sufficiently enough comments (-5 points)
    
    3. forgetting to find average as well (printing only sum and count)  (-5 points)
    
    4. using 'j' instruction instead of 'b' (-2 points)
        instead of:
            j loop  #   <-- less efficient, can be problematic when 
                    #       assembling multiple .s files
        write:
            b loop  #   <-- more efficient, no problem with multiple
                    #       assembly files
                    
    5. unnecessary branches: (-2 points)
         
            b mainEnd   #   branch to next line of code, unnecessary   
            
       mainEnd:
            li $v0, 10
            syscall
            
    6. if count is zero, then we should not divide sum by count. Instead
        print 0 for average (-2 points)
