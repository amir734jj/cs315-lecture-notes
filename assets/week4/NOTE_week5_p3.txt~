Do the following addition on the following two's complement 8 bit numbers and indicate if overflow occurs or not:

        1010 1010   --> -86
    +   0101 0101   --> +85
        ---------
        1111 1111   --> -1
        
--> adding a negative number with a positive number,
    the signs are different, hence overflow cannot
    occur.
    
        0100 0001   --> +65
    +   0100 0010   --> +66
        ---------
        1000 0011   --> -125
        
--> adding two positive numbers, the signs are the same
    and we can see that overflow occurred. Because result
    of adding two positive numbers yielded negative result.
    
        1000 0001   --> -127
    +   1000 0010   --> -126
        ---------
        0000 0011   --> +3
        
--> adding two negative numbers, the signs are the same
    and we can see that overflow occurred. Because result
    of adding two negative numbers yielded positive result.
    
    
Note:
    adding numbers with the same sign   <-- overflow can occur (because magnitude gets larger)
    adding numbers with different sign  <-- overflow cannot occur (as magnitude gets smaller)
